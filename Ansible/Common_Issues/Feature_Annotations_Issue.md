When using Ansible to gather facts, you may encounter a `SyntaxError: future feature annotations is not defined` error. This issue typically arises because the Python interpreter on the target host is an older version that does not support modern Python syntax, such as `from __future__ import annotations`.

### **Ansible Error: `SyntaxError` on Host**

  * **Error:** `SyntaxError: future feature annotations is not defined`
  * **Reason:** Ansible's internal modules and dependencies require a newer version of Python (typically Python 3.8 or later) that supports the `annotations` feature. The traceback shows that the host is attempting to run a Python script (`AnsiballZ_setup.py`) using an older interpreter that cannot parse this syntax. In this specific case, the original Python version was likely Python 3.6, which does not fully support `from __future__ import annotations`.

### **Solution: Changing the Python Version**

To fix this, you need to ensure that the target host's default Python interpreter is a version compatible with Ansible. The provided image demonstrates how to use the `alternatives` command on a Red Hat-based system to change the default Python 3 version.

#### **1. Check Current Python Version**

First, check which version of Python is being used by default.

```bash
root@tpaldiipva234:~# which python3
/usr/bin/python3
```

You can verify the version directly by running the `python3` command.

#### **2. Change the Default Interpreter**

Use the `alternatives --config` command to switch the default version.

```bash
root@tpaldiipva234:~# alternatives --config python3

There are 3 programs which provide 'python3'.

  Selection    Command
-----------------------------------------------
*+ 1           /usr/bin/python3.6
   2           /usr/bin/python3.9
   3           /usr/bin/python3.12

Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number: 3
```

In this example, the user selects option `3` to switch from Python 3.6 to Python 3.12, which is compatible with the required syntax.

#### **3. Verify the Change**

After making the change, re-run the `which` and `python3` commands to confirm the new version is active.

```bash
root@tpaldiipva234:~# which python3
/usr/bin/python3
root@tpaldiipva234:~# python3
Python 3.12.10 (main, Apr 14 2025, 03:00:22) [GCC 8.5.0 20210514 (Red Hat 8.5.0-26)] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> exit()
```

By switching to a more recent Python version on the target host, you resolve the syntax error and allow Ansible to execute tasks successfully.
