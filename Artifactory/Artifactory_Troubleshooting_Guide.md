HTTP status codes and common errors in Artifactory, NPM, Maven, and Docker can be tricky to troubleshoot. Here's a Markdown-formatted guide for a GitHub README that simplifies the process, using a generalized format without specific company names.

### **Artifactory Troubleshooting Guide**

This document provides a guide for troubleshooting common issues with Artifactory, including HTTP status codes, Docker, NPM, and Maven errors, as well as general access and replication problems.

-----

### **HTTP Status Code Issues**

#### **401 Unauthorized** üö´

This error occurs when you have **missing or expired credentials**.

  * **How to Fix:**
      * Check your permissions for the repository and the activity you're trying to perform (e.g., deploy, push).
      * For Docker, perform a `docker login` to refresh your token.
        ```bash
        docker login your-registry.your-domain.com
        ```

#### **403 Forbidden** üõë

This error means your credentials **do not have enough privileges** to access the repository or perform the requested action.

  * **How to Fix:**
      * Contact the repository administrator to request the necessary access. This is a permissions issue that only an admin can resolve.

#### **404 Not Found** üîé

This indicates that the artifact, file, or folder you're trying to access **does not exist** at the specified path.

  * **How to Fix:**
      * Remove any proxies and confirm the artifact is available in the specified path.
      * For Docker, this often means the image tag was deleted or never published. You can search the Artifactory UI to verify the image's existence.

#### **503 Service Unavailable** ‚è≥

A connection timeout can occur due to a firewall or proxy issue.

  * **How to Fix:**
      * **Firewall:** Check connectivity from your server to Artifactory using `telnet`.
        ```bash
        telnet your-artifactory.your-domain.com 443
        ```
      * **Proxy:** Check if a proxy is enabled with `env | grep proxy`. If so, disable it.
        ```bash
        unset http_proxy https_proxy no_proxy NO_PROXY
        ```

### **HTTP Status Code Issues by Package Type**

This section details specific errors for different package managers.

#### **NPM**

  * **401 error:** No authentication.
      * **Fix:** Check your `.npmrc` file and use Artifactory's "Set me up" feature to generate a new one.
  * **403 error:** No access.
      * **Fix:** Contact the repo administrator.
  * **404 error:** Package not available.
      * **Fix:** Search the Artifactory UI. If it's a public package, you may need to request that the Artifactory team mirrors it.
  * **503 error:** Proxy enabled.
      * **Fix:** Unset proxy environment variables and use `npm config rm` to remove proxy settings from your npm configuration.
  * **409 error:** Improper registry link.
      * **Fix:** Correct the registry URL in your `.npmrc` file to be `https://your-registry.your-domain.com/api/npm/<repo_name>`.

#### **Maven**

  * **401 error:** No authentication passed.
      * **Fix:** Ensure every `<repository>` in your `pom.xml` has a corresponding `<server>` entry in your `settings.xml` with proper credentials.
  * **403 error:** No access to file/repo.
      * **Fix:** Verify credentials and contact the repo administrator.
  * **404 error:** Package not available or repository not declared.
      * **Fix:** Search the Artifactory UI. If a public package, an administrator may need to add the repository to your virtual repo.
  * **503 error:** Proxy enabled.
      * **Fix:** Unset proxy environment variables and comment out or delete the `<proxies>` block in your `settings.xml`.
  * **409 error:** Improper repository link.
      * **Fix:** Correct the `<url>` in your `<repository>` declaration to the correct format, e.g., `https://your-registry.your-domain.com/artifactory/SAMPLE_REPO/`.

### **Docker Error Response Codes**

  * **401 error:** `failed to authorize: failed to fetch oauth token: unexpected status: 401 Unauthorized`
      * **Issue:** `docker login` was not executed or credentials have expired.
      * **Fix:** Log out and log back in to refresh your credentials.
        ```bash
        docker logout your-registry.your-domain.com
        docker login your-registry.your-domain.com
        ```
  * **403 error:** `pulling from host failed with status code [manifests latest]: 403 Forbidden`
      * **Issue:** Credentials lack sufficient access.
      * **Fix:** Contact the repository administrator for permissions.
  * **404 error:** Image not available.
      * **Issue:** The image tag does not exist or has been deleted.
      * **Fix:** Check the Artifactory UI. You may be able to restore the image from the trash bin.

### **General Access Issues**

#### **Artifactory CI or Production**

  * **Issue:** Unable to connect to the Artifactory server.
  * **Fix:** Check network connectivity with `telnet`. If it fails, raise a firewall request.

#### **Repository Access**

  * **Issue:** A user cannot access a repository.
  * **Fix:** The repository administrator can grant access. If the admins have left, create a support ticket to request a new admin.

#### **Code Promotion or Replication**

  * **Issue:** Data replication is not happening from the CI instance to the Production instance.
  * **Fix:** In most setups, the production instance is **read-only**, and replication happens only through designated `-prod` repositories. Direct builds and deployments to the production instance are restricted.
