### ðŸŒ³ Linux File System Hierarchy

This guide explains the purpose of key directories in the Linux file system and provides examples of the kind of files or subdirectories you would find in each.

-----

### `/` (Root Directory)

The top-level directory from which all other directories and files branch. It is the starting point of the entire file system.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /
bin   boot  dev  etc  home  lib   media  mnt  opt   proc  root  run   sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
```

-----

### `/boot` (Boot Loader Files)

Contains files essential for the system to boot, including the Linux kernel and the GRUB bootloader configuration.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /boot/
config-5.15.0-78-generic  grub/  initrd.img-5.15.0-78-generic  System.map-5.15.0-78-generic  vmlinuz-5.15.0-78-generic
```

-----

### `/etc` (Configuration Files)

Holds system-wide configuration files and scripts. These are plain text files that control how the system and its services behave.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /etc/
apache2/  bash.bashrc  crontab  fstab  hosts  nginx/  os-release  passwd  resolv.conf
```

**Example File Content (`/etc/passwd`):**

```bash
$ cat /etc/passwd | head -n 2
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
```

-----

### `/home` (User Home Directories)

Houses directories for individual users. Each user has a dedicated folder for their personal files, preferences, and configurations.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls -l /home/
total 8
drwxr-xr-x 2 john john 4096 Aug 16 2025 john
drwxr-xr-x 2 mary mary 4096 Aug 16 2025 mary
```

-----

### `/root` (Root Home Directory)

The home directory of the **root** user. Only the root user has access to this directory.

**Example Output:**

```bash
# This can only be seen with root privileges
$ sudo ls /root/
.bash_history  .profile  .ssh/
```

-----

### `/opt` (Third-Party Applications)

Contains add-on software packages and third-party applications that are not part of the default system.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /opt/
google/  microsoft/
```

-----

### `/dev` (Device Files)

Contains special files that represent hardware devices like disks, terminals, and USB devices. These are not ordinary files; they are interfaces to the hardware.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /dev/
null  sda  sda1  sr0  ttyS0  zero
```

-----

### `/var` (Variable Files)

Stores files that are expected to grow in size, such as logs, caches, mail, and temporary files. This data is dynamic and changes during system operation.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /var/
cache/  lib/  local/  lock/  log/  mail/  opt/  run/  spool/  tmp/
```

**Example File Content (`/var/log/syslog`):**

```bash
$ tail /var/log/syslog
Aug 16 09:30:01 server kernel: [12345.6789] usb 1-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using ohci_hcd
Aug 16 09:30:02 server kernel: [12345.9876] input: Logitech USB-HID as /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.0/0003:046D:C077.0001/input/input16
```

-----

### `/bin` (User Binaries)

Contains essential user command binaries required for basic system operation, available to all users.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /bin/
bash  cat  chmod  cp  date  df  echo  grep  ls  mkdir  mv  ps  pwd  rm  tar
```

-----

### `/sbin` (System Binaries)

Stores essential system binaries used for system administration tasks. These commands often require root privileges.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /sbin/
fdisk  fsck  ifconfig  iptables  mkfs  reboot  route  shutdown
```

-----

### `/usr` (User Applications)

The largest directory, containing user applications, libraries, documentation, and source code. This is where most installed software resides.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /usr/
bin/  games/  include/  lib/  local/  sbin/  share/  src/
```

-----

### `/proc` (Process Information)

A **virtual file system** that provides a view of kernel and process information. Its contents are not stored on disk but are generated by the kernel in real time.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /proc/
1/  2/  3/  cpuinfo  meminfo  mounts  modules  uptime
```

**Example File Content (`/proc/cpuinfo`):**

```bash
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep "model name"
model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700 CPU @ 2.90GHz
```

-----

### `/mnt` (Mount Directory)

A temporary location where administrators can manually mount external storage devices (e.g., additional hard drives, network shares) for access.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /mnt/
backup_drive/  shared_folder/
```

-----

### `/sys` (Virtual File System)

Similar to `/proc`, this is a **virtual file system** that provides information about the kernel, hardware devices, and drivers.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /sys/
block/  bus/  class/  devices/  firmware/  fs/  kernel/  module/
```

-----

### `/media` (Removable Devices)

Used for the automatic mounting of removable storage media, such as USB drives, CDs, or DVDs.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /media/
siddhu/
```

-----

### `/run` (Temporary File System)

Stores runtime data used by system processes since the last boot. This data is non-persistent and is cleared on system reboot.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /run/
log/  media/  mount/  systemd/  user/
```

-----

### `/tmp` (Temporary Files)

Used by applications to store temporary files that are automatically deleted when the system is rebooted. Any user can write to this directory.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /tmp/
vmware-root/  kwinrc.tmp  systemd-private-e8674d8122...
```

-----

### `/lost+found` (Recover Broken Files)

A directory created during the recovery process after a system crash or improper shutdown. It contains recovered files that were part of the file system but became corrupted.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /lost+found/
# This directory is typically empty unless a file system check (fsck) is run.
```

-----

### `/lib` (System Libraries)

Stores shared libraries needed by the essential binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.

**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /lib/
aarch64-linux-gnu/  firmware/  systemd/  udev/
```

-----

### `/srv` (Service Data Directory)

Contains data for services provided by the system.
**Example Output:**

```bash
$ ls /srv/
www/  ftp/  git/
```
